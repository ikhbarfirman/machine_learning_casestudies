## Problem Statement

Movie reviews are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie. While providing a numerical/stars rating to a movie tells us about the success or failure of a movie quantitatively, a collection of movie reviews is what gives us a deeper qualitative insight on different aspects of the movie. We can classify whether a person liked the movie or not based on the review they give for the movie. This is particularly useful in cases when the creator of a movie wants to measure its overall performance using reviews that critics and viewers are providing for the movie. It can also be used to create a recommender by providing recommendation of movies to viewers on the basis of their previous reviews.
