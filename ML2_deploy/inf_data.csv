340291,rw0704975,nbarratt,The Matrix Reloaded (2003),5.0,It's been a long time coming...,15 July 2003,0,"Trinity falling backwards through the window in slo-mo followed by the Agent---Cool. Neo fighting dozens of Agent Smiths---Pretty Cool, Very Clever. The Car Chase---Very Very Cool.It's a real shame the rest of the movie is a pretentious, uninteresting, overrated piece of crap, because I was really looking forward to this one.Trouble is, like Star Wars, they have a guaranteed (yet undeserved) audience for the final installment.","['0', '0']"
195744,rw0286124,the red duchess,Close-Up (1990),8.0,Almost lives up to his reputation.,8 November 2000,0,"This is apparently the most important film of the 1990s.  It did not move or astonish me as much as 'Sonatine', 'Chungking Express' or 'Le Temps Retrouve', but, then, I am a very superficial person.  The film is acclaimed for its blurring of 'documentary' and 'fiction' (hasn't Godard been doing this for decades?), but for me the film's most remarkable, poignant, powerful scene, as Sabzian sits in vulnerable silence just before his arrest, is pure artifice, an artifice I may not have noticed, though, without the documentary framework.  Kiarostami is such an intellectual heavy weight that I'd been afraid to watch him - what is notable is how the abstract ideas grow from a very concrete engagement with people and place - the bottle rolling down the street is symbolic, but is also simply, beautifully observed.  I won't give up my Kitano videos just yet, but, yeah, I can watch more of this.","['9', '18']"
274406,rw0631834,avanhame,The Patriot (2000),10.0,Excellent,22 July 2000,0,"After reading the reviews, I felt it necessary to see the film. It was well produced, acted, and the music all complemented each other. While some history was skewed, the storyline kept you waiting for the movement forward.  I found this film to be a well worth time investment, and when available in DVD I will purchase it for my film library.","['13', '20']"
83292,rw0156557,dean29,Suspiria (1977),2.0,This movie is not scary,17 August 2002,0,Warning:  If you have heard good reviews about this movie and never seen it then just stay away from it.  I like well made movies and I like horror movies.  This is neither.  This movie would not have been scary in 1978. This movie is only scary for being so bad.  If you want to see a movie from this time period then rent the original Exorcist and stay away from this.,"['10', '24']"
370401,rw0738431,MattPDX,The Trip (2002),10.0,GREAT movie!!!,26 February 2002,0,"Miles Swain has directed an excellent movie. The cast is perfect, cinematography beautiful...the whole thing just comes together. I would jump at the chance to be in one of his films! I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future...!","['1', '3']"
430648,rw0805812,cscorder,Sakuya: y√¥kaiden (2000),7.0,Nice Eastern eye candy,8 November 2001,0,"Credible action flick even if it's obviously a kid's movie. Great special effects are the primary attraction here. The cast treats the material with deadly seriousness, but they're fun to watch anyway. And the fight scenes are above average. But some parts looked like a bad rehash of ""H.R. Puffenstuff.""","['1', '1']"
123423,rw0202834,isotope2112,The Meaning of Life (1983),5.0,"Funny, but uneven",21 March 2003,0,"I just saw The Meaning of Life again recently.  I originally saw it about 10 years ago.  My memory of this movie was really fixated on the ""Birth"" and ""Death"" segments of the film, which are by far the funniest parts, and are in my opinion funnier than anything from Holy Grail or Life of Brian.  The middle segments however are nowhere near as good.  Still, Meaning of Life is worth seeing just for the beginning and end; it's still better than most of the schlock being produced today as ""Comedy"".  Just keep the remote handy to skip through the dull and unfunny middle segments.  5/10","['0', '5']"
296324,rw0656047,FlickJunkie-2,The Omega Code (1999),2.0,Uniformly awful,27 April 2000,0,"This film was dreadful in almost every regard.  The story concept was intriguing, but the writing was terrible and the presentation was butchered. The basic premise was that the mysteries of prophesy for all of human history were encoded into the bible.  A bible scholar breaks the code and he is killed and the code stolen by Stone Alexander (Michael York) who then uses it in his attempt to set himself up as king of the world.The direction in this film was awful.  Robert Macarelli was uniformly bad in direction of the actors, the camera work, and the use of cheesy special effects.  The film had the look and feel of a bad TV production.But Macarelli's paucity of talent in direction was greatly exceeded by the abysmal acting.  No number of acting lessons will ever help Casper Van Dien. He was so plastic and forced in his presentation that I retched at almost every line.  He needs to be modeling clothing in magazines or some other endeavor where we don't have to hear him speak.Michael York, who is actually a good actor, seemed like he had caught whatever bad acting virus Dien brought to the set, since his performance was also stiff and overacted.  Michael Ironside gave his standard bad guy performance which was probably the only decent acting in the film.In a word this movie can only be described as AARRRRRGH.  Avoid it like bubonic plague.  If you must see it, be sure not to eat for at least five hours beforehand.  I rate it a 2/10 (and that is being kind).","['3', '7']"
318951,rw0681195,Zar,Maciste il vendicatore dei Maya (1965),3.0,A very weird experience!,6 June 2001,0,"The extremely obscure Kirk Morris vehicle MACISTE, AVENGER OF THE MAYANS (the English title although I've never managed to locate any English language print) is a very weird experience even as sword & sandal goes, since the film in fact consists mostly of footage from FIRE MONSTERS VS THE SON OF HERCULES (starring Reg Lewis) and COLOSSUS AGAINST THE HEADHUNTERS (starring Kirk Morris) with new linking material featuring Morris added. Poor Reg Lewis has been almost completely eliminated from the footage (but if you look closely it's still him who throws the spear at the water dragon). Cramming together the plots of two different films into one makes the scenery fairly crowded - after all FIRE MONSTERS introduced three different tribes - and now there's no less than five of them fighting each other in turns. Plus the director tosses in a cheesy cave-dwelling giant to tip the powerscale!","['4', '4']"
343408,rw0708500,azaro666,The Tailor of Panama (2001),5.0,What did I miss?,25 May 2001,0,"I am still convinced, even now, that I have missed something with this movie. I am convinced that I fell asleep, after all I must have done because I missed the plot.The movie plays fine otherwise, after all the acting is fairly spot-on. Curtis is pouting to her best ability, Rush is as always reliable, and Brosnan has really found a role to suit his style of acting but in all truth, what good is any of that if there is no framework to place it within. A bit like having 30 brushes, all the write paints, a lovely easel but no canvas. Something must have been lost from the script, it has to be. I haven't read the book and so cannot be able to place my own finger on it, but surely this cannot have been all that was in it.There is a clear direction for the film to be travelling in, with the spying and such like, and there is room for some great comedy moments from Brosnan. This espionage style is lost though, as instead it turns into a rather farcical look at greed, desire and lust. The spying is soon stopped and the culmination of the film is that none of what has preceeded has been of any value or benefit. It plays as if there are two films, one which for 90 minutes looked to be boiling up to a twisty turvy crackerjack ending,and the second was a 10 minute ending from a family drama. It is clearly trying to get one over on the audience and its a cliche to say that memoirs of sixth sense spring up but thats all it is, an ending which surprised no-one and pleased only the director. Boorman has slipped on a real banana hear and makes himself look foolish with an amateur ending.","['0', '0']"
