## Background
 
Companies pay astonishing amounts of money to sponsor events  and raise brand visibility. Event sponsoring and social media is a well-established marketing strategy to build brand awareness.  
- There are 72% of consumers positively view brands that provide them with positive experiences, such as a great sports game or music festival. [(eventmarketer study)](https://www.eventmarketer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016EventTrackExecSummary.pdf)
- According to [Harvard researchers](https://www.inc.com/logan-chierotti/harvard-professor-says-95-of-purchasing-decisions-are-subconscious.html), about 90% of purchasing decisions are subconscious. So, the higher is brand visibility for communities on the web, the more impact a brand has on consumer buying activity.
- Chevrolet pays $71.4 million dollars each year to put its brand on Manchester United shirts. [(brandwatch)](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/how-to-measure-brand-awareness/)

The logo detection technology allows scanning images and real-time video streams for logos to get real uses of products by customers, facilitate monitoring the ROI of marketing campaigns, ensure revenue boost, and more.
